					<h2>Marx admirer Corbyn elected UK opposition Labour leader</h2>
					<img src="img/33.jpeg" alt="33">
					<p>Jeremy Corbyn, a veteran left-winger who professes an admiration for Karl Marx, was elected leader of Britain's opposition Labour party on Saturday, a victory that may make a British EU exit more likely and which one former Labour prime minister has said could leave their party unelectable.

Greeted by cheers from supporters in the room and hailed by radicals across Europe, Corbyn's triumph opened up the prospect of deep splits within Labour with some fearing he will repel voters with radical policies that include unilateral nuclear disarmament, nationalization and wealth taxes.

"Things can and they will change," Corbyn, who when he entered the contest was a rank outsider, said in his acceptance speech after taking 59.5 percent of votes cast, winning by a far bigger margin than anyone had envisaged.

"I say thank you in advance to us all working together to achieve great victories, not just electorally for Labour, but emotionally for the whole of our society to show we don't have to be unequal, it doesn't have to be unfair, poverty isn't inevitable," the gray-haired, bearded 66-year-old said.

His victory reflects growing support for left-wing movements across Europe, with Syriza winning an election in Greece in January and Spain's anti-austerity party Podemos performing well in opinion polls. Both parties welcomed the news.

"The election of Corbyn to the Labour leadership ... is a significant boost to the pan-European front against austerity and sends a message of hope to European peoples," Syriza said in a statement.

Corbyn's rise also has an echo of the way Senator Bernie Sanders has galvanized left-leaning Democrats in his bid to beat Hillary Clinton to the party's nomination for the U.S. presidential race.

However, the scale of division Corbyn's victory has created in his own party was immediately laid bare with one Labour lawmaker quitting his role as a health spokesman while Corbyn was making his acceptance speech.

Others quickly followed, saying they would not serve in his senior team.

"My job is going to be a complicated one, that I fully understand," Corbyn told hundreds of supporters singing the socialist anthem "The Red Flag", Labour's traditional song since 1925, at a celebration in the tiny Sanctuary House pub near parliament.

LABOUR SWERVING LEFT

A vegetarian republican who only received backing from fellow Labour lawmakers to enter the contest to ensure wide debate, Corbyn has struck a chord with many Labour supporters by repudiating the pro-business consensus of Tony Blair, who won three elections for Labour but is now widely unpopular, not least because of his involvement in the invasion of Iraq.

Corbyn has offered wealth taxes and ambiguity about EU membership. He is a strong opponent of military strikes in Syria, meaning it would be harder for Prime Minister David Cameron to win parliamentary support to bomb Islamic State targets there he considers a threat to British security.
